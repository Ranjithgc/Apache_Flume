Apache_Flume

Storing real time user stock data from alpha vantage API to HDFS using Apache Flume

    Step 1: get the api key by visiting the site https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key

    Step 2: go through the documentation of stock api and get the python code for Time Series Stock APIs

    Step 3: write the python code on a stock.py file and add the api key using the .env file.

    Step 4: if all the steps are gone well the we can see the output of the stock data While running this program.

    Step 5: Now we have to to go inside our flume directory like in my case from terminal cd Apache/flume-1.9.0/conf and after that create a conf file i.e

    $ touch stock.conf and add the flume configuration like source,channel and sink details there.

    Step 6: Now if the conf file is ready then we can execute the below command by going inside flume directory from terminal:

    $ Apache/flume-1.9.0

    Command : bin/flume-ng agent â€“conf ./conf/ -f conf/stock.conf -n agent1 -Dflume.root.logger=INFO

    Step 7: now we can see our output or file is successfully written by sink in our hdfs as stock_data
